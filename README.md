# Cobalt
Cobalt is a small programming language designed for general purpose and systems level scripting. This project follows very closely to the curriculum from [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom, and is intended to be a pet project for myself to learn programming language design and interpreter design concepts.

Currently, Cobalt follows the same grammer and design structure as [Lox](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters), the language featured in Nystrom's book. However, I eventually plan to mutate Cobalt from these design patterns and create a unique syntax and structure once I have reached a high enough proficiency.

This project is a **work in progress**, so some things might be a bit broken. YMMV :)
